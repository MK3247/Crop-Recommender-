# Motivation

Crop selection for many  farmers OFTEN feels like sitting for a difficult exam.
Most prospective farmersâ€“even experienced horticulturists find themselves struggling to decide what to grow.
They see themselves having no clue in the world about the right crop for their farm. 
This is a machine learning project that recommends the best crop to grow based on Soil composition, 
Ph level, rainfall and geographical location. 

# Technologies Used

* Flask (Back End) 
* Bootstrap5 (Front End) 
* Random Forest Classifier (ML Algorithm)

## Feature

- Takes in soil properties and amount of rainfall around the area and uses that data to recommend the best crop suited based on the conditions.
